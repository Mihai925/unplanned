# unplanned

A simple tool that will just let you generate random names. These will be an adjective and a noun separated by a dash.

Examples are: excellent-engine, hypnotic-pickle, etc. There are currently 877000 possible different combinations.

Why would you care for this? Well, this can be a good default option for project names, user names, etc. 

A little help to the UX that takes 2 minutes to do.
